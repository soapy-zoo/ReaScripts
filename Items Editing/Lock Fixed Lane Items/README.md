# Important notice
If you are using these scripts, make sure to go to ```REAPER Preferences``` -> ```Editing Behavior``` and set ```Locked item ripple editing behavior``` to ```Locked items are unaffected by ripple```.

# Overview
This collection of ReaScripts lets you lock / unlock all items on fixed item lanes except for the topmost one (usually the comp lane).
The scripts work with grouped tracks also.

**This means you are able to work in ripple edit mode on your comp lane without messing up the other lanes (especially if they are hidden).**

# Limitations
If there is no item selected and a split action is performed, locked items will split anyway (REAPER issue / weirdness).

Other: please let me know!
